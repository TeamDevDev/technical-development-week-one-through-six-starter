## Assessment Overview

Answer all of the following questions in the specified fashion. Please
note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository has a passing
build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have adequately answered
all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to each of them.

Please note that you are invited to provide responses to all of these questions
as a part of your **Technical Development** grade in this course. It is
important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory answers to all of
these questions you will not earn a satisfactory assessment for one or more
parts of the assessment of your work in the technical development category.

TODO: You should delete all of the prompts in this file so as to ensure that the
final document is a comprehensive report about your technical development.

#### From the perspective of technical development and the content in the Fuzzing/Debugging book, what is your greatest weakness? Why? How do you plan to improve after the completion of this course?

TODO: Write a brief one paragraph response to this question.

### Lessons Learned in Technical Development

Write one sentence to summarize what you have learned about each skill in the
area of **technical development for software engineering**. Each sentence
that you write should be accompanied by at least one reference that supports
your summarization. While you are encouraged to cite content from the "Software
Engineering at Google" book, it is acceptable for you to cite any source
available online. Please make sure that every reference that you provide is to
a web site link that the instructor can reference. Ultimately, you can think of
the sentence that you write as advice that you would give to a student at the
start of the next edition of the Software Engineering course.

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the prompts in the following sections.

#### Code Coverage

TODO: Write one sentence about this skill.
TODO: Provide at least one reference to support your assertion.
TODO: Your reference should be a URL in the "Software Engineering at Google" book
      or a reference to a reputable web site that you found online.

#### Mutation Testing

TODO: Write one sentence about this skill.
TODO: Provide at least one reference to support your assertion.
TODO: Your reference should be a URL in the "Fuzzing Book"
      or a reference to a reputable web site that you found online.

#### "Black Box" Testing

TODO: Write one sentence about this skill.
TODO: Provide at least one reference to support your assertion.
TODO: Your reference should be a URL in the "Fuzzing Book"
      or a reference to a reputable web site that you found online.

#### "White Box" Testing

TODO: Write one sentence about this skill.

## Learning Objectives

After consulting the [Learning
Objectives](https://developerdevelopment.com/syllabus/#learning-objectives) for
the Software Engineering course, pick at least one of them that **connects to
technical development** and write the learning objective in its entirety
below this paragraph. Next, accurately assess your attainment of that learning
objective on a scale between 1 and 5 where 1 indicates that you are emerging as
a learner for the objective and 5 indicates that you are developer who expertly
completes tasks associated with the learning objective and are prepared to
effectively teach it to others.

### Restatement of Learning Objective

- SE-3: Can effectively create and use software engineering tools that support
software engineering activities like testing and debugging.

### Assessment of Your Attainment of the Learning Objective

- [] 1 (**Emerging**): The developer is beginning to learn this skill or concept
and needs significant guidance and/or support.
- [] 2 (**Developing**): The developer has some understanding but still needs
help and practice to fully grasp the skill or concept.
- [] 3 (**Competent**): The developer has a solid understanding and can
independently apply the skill or concept most of the time.
- [] 4 (**Proficient**): The developer has a deep understanding and can
consistently apply the skill or concept independently and effectively.
- [] 5 (**Expert**): The developer has mastered the skill or concept and can
apply it in complex situations and even teach it to others.

## Overall Course Assessment

Please note that your responses to these questions will neither positively nor
negatively influence your grade in the software engineering course. With that

and the technical leaders can best ensure that they delivered appropriate
instruction. Finally, please note that the responses that you give in this
subsection should apply to technical development, technical development,
project development, and your overall experiences as you develop as a developer.
